# Spring-2019-Robot2

For the final projet of my introduction to robotics class, I worked with 2 other students to create a robot that would explore a grid maze and recreate the maze onto the NXT brick's led display. The robot had a differential drive and used a sonar sensor to navigate and map the maze. The robot is given the dimensions of the maze and it uses a depth first search to explore each node of the maze and at each node, the robot would check it's surrondings and map it onto its screen.
