# Spring-2019-Robot2

For the final projet of my introduction to robotics class, I worked with 2 other students to create a robot that would explore a grid maze and recreate the maze onto the robot's led display screen. The robot was created using LEGO Mindstorms NXT robot kit and it was programmed using ROBOTC. The map was created using a big piece of plywood and some cardboard boxes as the obstacles. The robot had a differential drive and used a sonar sensor to navigate and map the maze. The robot is given the dimensions of the maze and it uses a depth first search to explore each node of the maze and at each node, the robot would check it's surrondings and map it onto its screen.
